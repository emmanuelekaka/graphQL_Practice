now where is the problem?
All along it has not been running  maybe letme run it in the terminal in vs en u see.
ok i changed it to server not server
There now is where the prob is. Okay

show me the actaully error your were getting last time?

is this the error?yes

you can not mix commonjs with es6 or es2015 when it's not configured to 
use es6. But when you config it with es6 you can use commonjs no problem.

It's okay now. thanks very much but i didn't notice where the problem was.
Oh okay. let me recreate it for you .

first problem was the ":" which is not required there.
second problem is that the name "Query" does exist in graphql type because it was written in lowcase.

"Query" defined in resolvers, but not in schema

so basically what it's say is that Query is not define in schema types which is true because as of now it's written in lowcase letter. so let's change that.

all good now?Thanks very much sir for the time
your welcome no problem.

Okay
i think this is goodnight now right?ya a good nyt too
alright. bye bye
